          <p><strong>Project:</strong> CodeBrew Caf√© ‚Äî a mobile-first platform designed to simplify and centralize coding tutorials for students and self-taught developers.</p>
          <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 5 weeks | <strong>Role:</strong> Solo UX Designer | <strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Google Docs, Slides</p>
          <p>
            What began as a personal frustration ‚Äî finding quality, affordable coding resources ‚Äî turned into a deeply researched, highly iterative mobile experience designed for ease, clarity, and accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case study, you'll see how I turned personal insights into inclusive features, built a brand around supportive learning, and iterated based on real student feedback.

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
        <p>
          I analyzed platforms like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and Scrimba to evaluate their accessibility, layout, and how they guide users through content. While some offered a clean onboarding flow, others were cluttered or overwhelming, especially for beginners.
        </p>
        <p>
          I noticed a lack of personalization, inconsistent navigation patterns, and limited mobile optimization ‚Äî key gaps I aimed to improve with CodeBrew Caf√©.

        <h3>White Paper Research</h3>
        <p>
          I dug into published research around digital learning for underrepresented students. Several findings highlighted the importance of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Progressive skill reinforcement</li>
          <li>Low-friction interfaces</li>
          <li>Consistent UI patterns for cognitive retention</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These insights grounded my early decisions and pushed me toward clean, focused layouts with minimal distractions.

      </div>
  
      <!-- User Interviews -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted interviews with 4 students across different backgrounds ‚Äî all of whom had tried learning to code online. Their feedback aligned with my audit: tutorials were often too advanced, too disorganized, or too expensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most users wanted bite-sized learning, intuitive navigation, and the ability to "bookmark" where they left off.

      </div>
  
      <!-- Personas -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>
          From the research, I created two main personas ‚Äî one being a college student juggling part-time work, the other a self-taught developer switching careers. These personas helped me stay grounded in real user needs as I moved into design.

      <!-- Design Principles -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Design Principles</h3>
        <p>
          With my research insights in mind, I framed three guiding principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep it Simple:</strong> Strip down visual noise and surface what matters.</li>
          <li><strong>Progress, Not Pressure:</strong> Let users move at their pace, bookmark lessons, and celebrate milestones.</li>
          <li><strong>Feel Friendly:</strong> Soften the experience with cozy UI touches ‚Äî rounded edges, warm colors, and conversational microcopy.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <!-- User Flows -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>User Flows</h3>
        <p>
          I mapped out key flows ‚Äî including "Find a Tutorial," "Bookmark Progress," and "Browse by Category." Each one was designed to minimize taps and reduce decision fatigue.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Sketches & Wireframes -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Sketches & Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          I started with quick hand-drawn sketches to shape layout ideas. From there, I moved into grayscale wireframes in Figma to block out structure and component hierarchy before layering in color or imagery.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Final UI Decisions -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>High-Fidelity UI</h3>
        <p>
          The final UI is clean and purposefully sparse ‚Äî built for mobile-first, low-distraction learning. Color is used intentionally to guide the eye and emphasize actions. Typography is legible and friendly, with accessible contrast ratios across modes.

      <h2>üß™ Testing & Feedback</h2>
  
      <!-- Usability Testing -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Usability Testing Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I ran 3 rounds of unmoderated testing with peers and students who regularly used coding tools. I asked them to complete tasks like finding a tutorial, saving a lesson, and returning to a bookmarked section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants used mobile and tablet devices ‚Äî and I observed behaviors like hesitation, drop-off points, and confusion with icon meanings.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Key Feedback -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Key Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>‚ÄúContinue Watching‚Äù wasn‚Äôt clearly tappable ‚Äî felt like a static label.</li>
          <li>The search bar blended too much with the background.</li>
          <li>People expected icons for tutorial type (video, interactive, reading).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Iterations Made -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>What I Changed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Made CTAs bolder and used visual affordances (shadows, hover states).</li>
          <li>Increased visual hierarchy of the top nav and search field.</li>
          <li>Added subtle iconography for content types, improving scan-ability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These changes led to clearer task flows and reduced time-to-completion in follow-up tests.

        <h3>The Final Product</h3>
        <p>
          The finished prototype offers a scrollable, mobile-first experience designed to meet learners where they are. From clean card layouts to intuitive navigation and save-for-later features, every interaction was shaped by user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users described the experience as ‚Äúclean,‚Äù ‚Äúmotivating,‚Äù and ‚Äúsomething I‚Äôd actually use,‚Äù which felt like a win.

          <li>Feedback scores on clarity, aesthetics, and ease of use improved with each round.</li>
          <li>This case study helped me land my internship with Amazon ‚Äî proof of the power of storytelling and user-centered thinking.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Reflection -->
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>
          This project taught me to trust the process ‚Äî and the users. I learned how to pace myself through ambiguity, let research guide design, and turn feedback into iteration momentum. Most importantly, I learned how to tell a clear story through UX work.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were to continue this project, I‚Äôd focus on real content partnerships, onboarding flows, and data-driven content recommendations.
